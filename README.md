Using an ESP32, this software enables information to be displayed on an OLED SSD1306 display concerning the execution of various operations on a third-party machine. 

A push-button is also connected to the ESP32 to trigger an action from the ESP32 to the third-party machine.

The ESP32 and the third-party machine exchange data via Bluetooth only.
